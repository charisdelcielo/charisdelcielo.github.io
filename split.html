        <h2> Overview </h2>
        <div class = "body-text">
          $plit provides a service for college students or any other users in similar finantial or habitual situation
           to split delivery fee with other users in the same area unit by adding your order to an existing order.

        <div class = "subtitle"> Problem Identified </div>
        <div class = "body-text">
          The problem that I tried to target is the unnecessary hiked up delivery fees
          that many food company charges.
          Very often, college students order food and have
          it delivered due to distance, convenience, or just pure laziness.
          Also, very few people on college campuses own cars, and thus they tend to use food delivery services frequently,
           thus providing us with even more opportunity.
           People that live in a community are less than likely to knock on their neighbors door
           and ask them to order food together.

         </div>

         <div class = "subtitle"> Existing Platforms, Exisitng Problems</div>
         <div class = "body-text">
           1. Joyrun - JoyRun tries to do what we do however,
           they still charge a “runner’s fee” that is still pricey for a delivery fee.

           <br> 2. Facebook - Some might consider Facebook a potential competitor
           because it’s a social networking application that includes messaging.
           However, there are serious privacy and security concerns if people are sharing
           their location with one another if they do not actually know each other.
           <br> Another limitation of Facebook is that people you know on
           Facebook do not necessarily live close to you, so order aggregation would not be feasible.
         </div>
        <div class = "subtitle"> High Level Goals </div>
        <div class = "body-text">
          <br>-Design a very detailed user flow for users to use our system to best save their delivery fees
          <br>-Design the user experience with which the users can have no privacy concerns regarding personal / location information

        </div>
        <div class = "subtitle"> User Study </div>
        <div class = "body-text">
          I created three user archetypes for our app and conducted
          user interviews with potential users who fit in each archetype.
          <br><br>
          <b>USER ARCHETYPES</b>
          • Unsatisfied freshmen: Students that live in dorms that are not satisfied with their meal plan that resort to delivering outside food
          <br>• Off-campus night-owls: Students that stay up late studying or partying that want a meal at an unusual time
          <br>• Broke New-Yorkers: People living a fast-paced lifestyle that don’t have time to drive into the city and don’t have money to spend on unnecessary fees
        </div>
        
        <div class = "subtitle"> Design Process </div>
        <div class = "body-text">
          After conducting user research and creating task scenarios, we created prototypes (lo-fi & functional) for three main tasks -- Registration, Start/Add Order (based on user preference), Cancel Order.

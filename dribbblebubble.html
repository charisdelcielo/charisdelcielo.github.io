        <h2> My role: Data Visualization (D3.js), Prototyping (Sketch), Web Development (HTML/CSS/JS)
          <br>Duration: 1mo
          <br> Overview: Dribbble Bubble! is a data visualization project that discovers
          interesting behavioral patterns of how the viewers' use different reactions (likes, saves, comments)
          to 500 posts from 3 popular categories (Illustration, UI/UX, Logo).
          <br> Motivation: Dribbble is an online community for designers to showcase
          their work and react to others’. I wanted to observe any interesting patterns in
          how the viewers react to various posts in different categories.
          <br> Question to answer: Are there different patterns in
          Dribbble users’ uses of <b>likes, saves, and comments</b> on posts in different
          categories of design work (illustration, UI/UX, logo)?
          <br> Assumptions: 1. UI/UX posts will receive more saves in general than Illustration posts
          because they have more contents and could be used as refereces by other designers.
          2. UI/UX and Logo posts will receive more comments than Illustration posts as other designers
          can criticize or complement the techniques or the content of the post.
          3. Illustration posts will receive more likes than UI/UX or Logo posts as they are
          more enjoyable and simple.
          <br> Design Process
          I designed the prototypes for the visualization with Sketch.
          Our team considered multiple approaches for the visualizations that allows us
          to compare three attributes at once. One idea was to use a triangle graph that has
          the three categories as the edges. However, the scaling of three numbers
          can be challenging as the number of likes are much larger than the other two,
          and thus the visualization could be misleading.
           <br> Simple is the best <br>
           We decided to have a graph with 2 axes with each colored dot representing a post when
           each of 3 colors corresponds to each category. Moreover, as a fan of visualizations that suggests user involvement, I wanted to add user interactions
          to the visualization. So, I created a legend with five features that the viewers can
          play around with.

          <br> Result & Observations
          Despite the obstacles and concerns we had regarding representing the data properly, we still
          discovered several interesting patterns and observations with our manually collected data.
          1. UI/UX posts generally received more comments than
          The dots for UI/UX posts were

          <br> Takeaways
          <br>Considering all of technical, aesthetic, and representative aspects of a visualization
          is quite challenging. If the type of visualization is expected to desirably represent the data,
          we face other challenges such as how technically feasible the idea is or visually aesthetic, user-friendly, and
          story-telling the outcome is.
          <br>When working on a data visualization project, we may face realistic or legal issues about
          collecting and using the data such as the copyright or the provider's policies.
          Thus, it is crucial to research about the feasilbility of data collection process in advance.

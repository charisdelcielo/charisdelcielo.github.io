          <h2> Overview </h2>
          <div class = "body-text">
            Dribbble Bubble! is a data visualization project that discovers
            interesting behavioral patterns of how the viewers' use different reactions (likes, saves, comments)
            to 3 popular categories (Illustration, UI/UX, Logo).

        <h2> Motivation </h2>
        <div class = "body-text">
          Dribbble is an online community for designers to showcase
          their work and react to others’. I wanted to observe any interesting patterns in
          how the viewers react to various posts in different categories.
        </div>

        <h2> Curiosity </h2>

        <div class = "body-text">
          How does Dribbble users’ uses of likes, saves, and comments differ on posts in different
          categories of design works (illustration, UI/UX, logo)?
        </div>

        <h2> Assumptions </h2>
        <div class = "body-text">
          1. UI/UX posts will receive more saves in general than Illustration posts
          because they have more contents and could be used as refereces by other designers.
          <br> 2. UI/UX and Logo posts will receive more comments than Illustration posts as other designers
          can criticize or complement the techniques or the content of the post.
          <br> 3. Illustration posts will receive more likes than UI/UX or Logo posts as they are
          more enjoyable and simple.
        </div>
        <h2> Design Process </h2>
        <div class = "body-text">
          I designed the prototypes for the visualization with Sketch.
          Our team considered multiple approaches for the visualizations that allows us
          to compare three attributes at once. One idea was to use a triangle graph that has
          the three categories as the edges. However, the scaling of three numbers
          can be challenging as the number of likes are much larger than the other two,
          and thus the visualization could be misleading.
           <br><br> Simple was the best. <br><br>
           We decided to have a graph with 2 axes with each colored dot representing a post when
           each of 3 colors corresponds to each category. Moreover, as a fan of visualizations that suggests user involvement, I wanted to add user interactions
          to the visualization. So, I created a legend with five features that the viewers can
          play around with.
        </div>

        <h2> Result  </h2>
        <div class = "body-text">

          Despite the obstacles and concerns we had regarding representing the data properly, we still
          discovered several interesting patterns and observations with our manually collected data such as:
          <br><br> 1. UI/UX posts generally received more comments than other two categories.
          <br> 2. The number of saves for UI/UX posts and Illustration posts are similar. (UI/UX posts do not necessarily get more saves.)

        <h2> Takeaways </h2>
        <div class = "body-text">
          Considering all of technical, aesthetic, and representative aspects of a visualization
          is quite challenging but is the key to a good visualization.
          <br>
          Also, it is crucial to research about the feasilbility and legality of data collection process in advance.
